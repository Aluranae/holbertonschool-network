# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a deep-dive into one of the most classic and frequently asked interview questions in the software engineering world:  
**“What happens when you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter?”**

Far from being a simple question, this topic explores all the major components of modern web infrastructure: from DNS to TCP/IP, encryption, firewalls, load balancers, servers, and databases.

By completing this project, students gain a solid understanding of how the web works behind the scenes — essential knowledge for developers, DevOps engineers, system administrators, and SREs.

## 📌 Tasks

### ✅ Task 0: What happens when...

> Write a blog post explaining what happens when you type  
> `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter.

Your article must cover the following components:

- DNS request
- TCP/IP
- Firewall
- HTTPS/SSL
- Load balancer
- Web server
- Application server
- Database

The article must be written in **English** and published on **Medium** or **LinkedIn**.  
Include the article URL in your `0-blog_post_url` file.

### ✅ Task 1: Everything's better with a pretty diagram

> Add a diagram to your blog post illustrating the **full request flow**.

Your diagram must clearly show:

- DNS resolution
- HTTPS request hitting a server IP and port
- Encrypted traffic
- Firewall filtering
- Load balancing
- Web server serving content
- Application server generating content
- Database query for data

You can use tools like **Gliffy**, **Draw.io**, or **Lucidchart** to create your diagram.

### ✅ Task 2: Contribute!

> Leave a comment on at least one other student's blog post.  
> The comment should be constructive, relevant, and respectful.

Then, add the link to your comment in the `2-comment_link` file.
